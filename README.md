# 🛠️ Static Site Generator
A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website (a mix of HTML and CSS files). This project was all about building a powerful and flexible static site generator from scratch. 

# 📖 Overview
What Does It Do?
This Static Site Generator (SSG) processes your content files, typically written in Markdown, and converts them into a fully-functional, static website. The output is a set of HTML and CSS files that you can easily deploy to any web server.

# 👨‍🔧 Why I built it?
